Validated Product Design Final Project Reviewer Guideline
===

## Context

This project is the first project for Tech Entrepreneur students. The Product Design course teaches students how to run design sprints, validate their ideas with students, and plan how to measure their product performance. Please remember Tech Entrepreneur students come from a diverse background of varying writing and business skills. As such, please include thorough and detailed comments where applicable.

Course materials can be found [here.](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud509-nd)

## Project Description

This project require students to design a product people will love. Students are expected to run a design sprint in order to quickly validate their idea with real customers. Students need to submit a writeup that contains:

* Product Idea Summary (max 100 words)
* Design Sprint Deliverables (e.g., wireframes, mockups, or low-fidelity prototypes of their product idea)
* Design Brief
* Feedback from User Testing (summary, max 250 words)
* Three Metrics to Measure (summary, max 250 words)


## Project Specification

### Important Points

#### Eliminate Bias
Before you read even one sentence in the student's writeup, go directly to the student's mockups or prototype and evaluate the student's mockup or prototype first! Why? You are evaluating how well the student's mockups or prototype can allow users easily determine 

1. what the product is
2. what the problem it solves
3. how they would use it

If you read the whole summary of what the product does, you may bias yourself because you already know what the product is supposed to do. Therefore, **first** look at the mockups and evaluate whether you can determine what the product is, what the problem it solves, and how you would use the product without bias.

Make sure to look at the screens ONE screen at a time. If you were a user, would you be able to figure out what the app is about on the very first home screen?

If you cannot figure out the app on the very first home screen, then the mockups do not meet specifications.

#### Do Not Judge Ideas
Do not grade based on the student's idea! Try to limit your bias at the beginning and do not pass judgment solely on the student's idea. You should only grade students on their ability to follow the steps and concepts they've learned in class. It does not matter what reviewers think of the idea - it's about finding what the customer thinks of the idea. Reviewers should help reinforce this mentality throughout the review.

#### PDF Annotations are Required

You need to go over the students' PDF and write in detailed comments about their writeup. We suggest you use the Kami plugin and load up your PDF file for review through Google Drive (Kami gets a little buggy if you load up the PDF directly on your computer).

You should preface all of your comments with either:

* Awesome
* Suggestion
* Required

where `Required` are the areas that the student needs to change in order to pass their next submission.

Here is an example of a PDF Annotation that you should emulate: [Product Design Sample PDF Annotation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2nHT38-eE13Zm5IcUJVendqbTg/view?usp=sharing)

#### Required comments in your annotation should be very prescriptive

In order to clearly communicate to students what they need to exactly do in order to meet specifications on their next submission, all required comments should be very prescriptive and should tell the student what they exactly need to do in order to meet specifications.

Here is an example:

A student's Design Sprint challenge statement is not complete. The ideal way to help the student is to say exactly what the student needs to write in order to write up a complete Design Sprint challenge statement. 

Here is an excellent example that one of our reviewers wrote:

> Your Sprint Challenge should articulate the challenge you will address during the sprint clearly enough so that someone who is not familiar with your product could understand what you are trying to do. Keep your focus on your user (specify the targeted user--which you did well in your first version). You should also include the target launch and platform information from your first Challenge Statement. I hope this explanation adds clarity to the expectation for your Challenge Statement. To summarize, here is what you need to do in your Challenge Statement:

> State an actionable challenge that your team will address during the sprint

> Define your user

> Define what the user should do with your app

> Include a specific launch time stamp

> Specify the product platform

An example of a non-prescriptive comment would be:

>  The challenge statement is
fundamentally about the design of the app. Here you talk
about markets, needs, and data. How do these things
relate to your design? It is absolutely great to be thinking
about that right now but how did you use the design sprint
to design your app to answer these questions?

The statement above is more of a critical statement and critical statements should be reserved for `suggestions` rather than `required` comments.

### 1 - Content Review

### Note on Word Limits

Summaries will have word limits, usually 250 words or 100 words.

Please count how many words the student uses for each summary. We want to teach the student that she needs to write succinctly. 

Therefore if the student goes over her word limit by a couple of words, it is okay. Do not fail the student if she went over the word limit by 5 words. There is a hard number though and if the student is over 15 words in her summary (such as 115 or 265) do not pass the student. Suggest to the student how she can shorten her summary.


#### Written Summary

The summary needs to clearly articulate the problem the student is trying to solve and outline the solution that the student came up with during the design sprint.

#### Design Sprint Prototype

The student needs to actually provide evidence that the student ran a design sprint by filling out a worksheet called the design brief. Make sure the design brief is completely filled out and the student has submitted the design brief.

Furthermore, the student must submit their wireframe, mockups, or low fidelity prototypes. Below is a definition of the prototype vocabulary we will use throughout the Nanodegree:

#### Design Sprint Challenge Statement

The statement should:

- Have a clear user defined
- Have a clear statement to what the user will be doing with the product

At a higher level, the design challenge statement should help the student answer one of two questions:

- What are you missing that you need critically?
- What is the riskiest decision or hypothesis that you want to test with users?

As long as the statement answers one of those two questions, it's fine.

Here are critical questions a team can ask that can drive their [design sprint] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BgyQ8MOru94b54o0fPmw8k5jIiW417GE02Pr_JG0YII/pub)

#### User Feedback Summary

Be very critical on the writeup for user feedback. The student should write about what she learned from showing their designs to real users. Students should be able to clearly identify:

* key learnings
* key insights 

gleaned from user testing and feedback.

Students need to answer *all* of these questions in their summary as well:

* What do users like?
* Does the user understand the app's purpose?
* Does the user know how to navigate the app without prompting?
* How do users describe the product? 

The student's write up should be very clear and very prescriptive to improve their write up. The reviewer should suggest the student to write in this format:

* Users liked....
* Users understood how to navigate the app without prompting (OR) Users had trouble navigating from the home screen to the pickup screen....
* Users described the product as ...
* Users understood the app's purpose to be a tool...

#### Metrics

Students should create metrics thats track key features and usage of the product instead of vanity metrics such as "downloads per week." It's very important at the early stage of their product design, students should track how well their users are successfully using their product. Students are highly encouraged to use the HEART framework they learned from the Product Design course:

* Happiness (ex: satisfication, NPS)
* Engagement (ex: user activity)
* Adoption (ex: new users, usage)
* Retention (ex: % active/unit of time)
* Task Success (ex: time, completed tasks, errors)

### 2. Writeup Review

#### Use of Proper Spelling/Grammer

We are encouraging students to develop professional-level writing skills so please comment whenever the following may occur:

* Spelling errors
* Run-on sentences
* Pronoun errors
* Misplaced modifiers
* Subject-verb disagreements
* Apostrophe usage

**Important**: Students should write in full sentences! Students should communicate their complete clearly and concisely as much as possible by using fully complete sentences.

#### Clarity of Writing

The student should accurately and clearly describe specific aspects and details of the product design plan. Please comment whenever the student's use of words causes confusion.

## Watch Outs

If the student submits files and links that are unreadable or cannot be commented on easily, please mark the project as ungradeable and encourage the student to use written formats that are more universally acceptable such as PDFs, JPG, GIF, Google Docs, Webpage, etc.
