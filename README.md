### How do I start reviewing?
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o3_ovnxIYI) gives a quick rundown on how to get started.

* **How does payment work?** <br /> 
  You will be paid via PayPal at the beginning of each month for the reviews done in the prior month. 
E.g. for the reviews completed in March 2015, you will be paid at the begining of April 2015. We require that you own the PayPal email address and you are a resident of one of the following countries: *Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Emirates, Estonia, Finland, France, French Guiana, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Martinique, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Reunion, Romania, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, Vietnam*.

Please send the following information to review-support@udacity.com. 
* Your Name

### When should I use the "can't review" button?
* If the submission is incomplete (i.e. missing files):
  * Let the student know which files are missing.
  * Please download the project submission before you decide that it is not reviewable. Sometimes, the code review tab will not show files if the extensions aren't right, but you can still review the project and send feedback to the student. 
* If the submission is complete (contains all necessary files) but doesn't compile:
  * Please tell the student what the issue is.
  * If you are unable to figure out the issue, please be honest with the student. Request the student to reach out to a coach and contact us at review-support@udacity.com.

### What should I do when reviewing a project?
* **You must download the project and run it on your machine.** Sometimes, the code review tab will not display every file. You must ensure that the files aren't missing by downloading the submission. 
* **We expect that you check each criterion given in the rubric.** Even if the student "does not meet specifications" for the first few criteria, you still must give feedback on ALL of the rubric criteria.
* For each criterion:
  * When the project "does not meet specifications":
    * Explain to the student "why?"
    * Give helpful links or examples that will help the student to fix all the issues with their project so that they meet specifications in their next iteration.
  * When the project "meets specifications" and the criterion does not have an "exceeds specifications" option:
    * Let the student know what they did particularly well.
  * When the project "meets specifications" but does not "exceed specifications":
    * Let the student know *why* they do not exceed specifications or how could they improve so that they can exceed specifications.  

**Your job is to ensure that the student has learned something valuable from your review and, after making any suggested changes (if required), the student meets specifications with their next submission.**

### What should I do if I disagree with a previous reviewer's call on a rubric criterion?
Strictly follow the given rubric to the best of your understanding. Acknowledge to the student that "this is different from what the earlier reviewer mentioned and you are reaching out to a Udacity coach to resolve this inconsistency." Please send us an email at review-support@udacity.com as soon as you come across cases of this with a link to the review and a list of which parts of the review you disagree with.  

It is important that we all interpret the rubric as similarly as possible and we welcome any comments or suggestions for how to effectively achieve this.

**Rule of thumb: follow the rubric strictly and let us know if you find any inconsistencies so that we can work with all of our reviewers to make the feedback consistent.**

### What should I do if I find a submission where student has not made sufficient progress from his last submission?
Send us an email. Have a look at the previous review the student has received. Do you think the student misunderstood the review they received from an earlier reviewer? Let us know at review-support@udacity.com why you think this student hasn't made much progress from their last submission. A Udacity coach will look into this and reach out to the student and offer help in making progress. 

### What should I do if a student asks a question in the rating comment they made? 
Please send us an email with the link to the review the student wrote feedback on. Also, write your response to the student. We will forward it to the appropriate student and include you (via cc) in the conversation.

### What should I do if a student gives a low rating and/or says that my feedback was not satisfactory?
Don't be discouraged. Send us an email and let us know if you have any clarification on the student's note. In many cases, there is a misunderstanding that might have caused this. We will work on this together to find out what happened and take appropriate actions. We will remove the comment from your records if we find that the rating is not reflective of the review you have given.

### What should I do if the student is really unhappy that the reviews he/she has been getting are inconsistent? 
Send us an email at review-support@udacity.com and we will look into it. In your email, include any insight on whether the earlier reviews are inconsistent and why they are inconsistent. Let the student know that a Udacity coach will get in touch with them via email and they should wait to hear from us before resubmitting. Do your best to strictly follow the rubric. A Udacity coach will reach out to the student. 

### Why did I get waitlisted?
Sometimes, we feel that you need some time to reflect on the project, rubric and the learning goals of the project. We do waitlist you in such cases to give you that time. We believe that you have what it takes to be a great reviewer and would love to give you an opportunity to review again in future. Please take this time to learn more about the project. Get back to us in a couple of months and we will consider giving you the opportunity to review the project again.
